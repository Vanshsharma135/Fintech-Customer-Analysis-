The "FinTech" company launch there android and iOS mobile base app and want to grow there business. 
But there is problem how to recomended this app and offer who realy want to use it. 
So for that company desided to give free trial to each and every customer for 24 houre and collect data from the customers. 
In this senariao some customer purchase the app and someone not.
According to this data company want to give special offer to the customer who are not interested to buy without offer and grow thre business.
This is a classification problem.

                                                  Accuracies of Different Algorithm

Decision Tree           :- 69.32%

K-NN                    :- 73.15%

Naive Bayes             :- 71.14%

Random Forest           :- 76.16%

Logistic Regression     :- 76.83%

SVM                     :- 77.89%

XGBoost                 :- 78.1%


**RESULT:-** XGBoost is the best classification algorithm for this model.
