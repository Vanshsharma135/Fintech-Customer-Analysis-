The "FinTech" company launched their Android and iOS mobile base app and wants to grow their business. But there is a problem with how to recommend this app and offer who really want to use it. So the company decided to give a free trial to each and every customer for 24 hours and collect data from the customers. In this scenario, some customers purchase the app and some do not. According to this data, the company wants to give special offers to customers who are not interested in buying without offers and grow their business.

# This is a classification problem.

                                                  Accuracies of Different Algorithm

Decision Tree           :- 69.32%

K-NN                    :- 73.15%

Naive Bayes             :- 71.14%

Random Forest           :- 76.16%

Logistic Regression     :- 76.83%

SVM                     :- 77.89%

XGBoost                 :- 78.1%


**RESULT:-** XGBoost is the best classification algorithm for this model.
